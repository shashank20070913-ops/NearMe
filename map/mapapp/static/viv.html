    <p>The Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, India, commemorates Swami Vivekananda's spiritual experience on a rock where he attained enlightenment in 1892, featuring two main structures (Vivekananda Mandapam & Sripada Mandapam) with blended Indian architecture, a large statue of Vivekananda, and a meditation hall, accessible by ferry from the mainland where the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean converge. </p>
